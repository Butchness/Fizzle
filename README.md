# Fizzle
This project is for a small scale RC car project. The intention of this project is mostly exploritory focusing on learning the various workflows and tools used in professional embedded developement. I will be forcusing on using the VScode IDE and git for handling file storage and file version control. 

With all this the task at hand is to transform a < 1/50 scale version of a Ford F-150 model vehicle, with basic mechanical functionality, into a functional RC car. This repository will be used in the documentation of this project as well as any source files that are used.

This project will be utilizing the AGILE project workflow. While new planned additions may be noted only one specific portion of this project will be focused on at a time, as is dictated by AGILE. 

Project milestones are as follows in no particular order,
- rear and front drive train (includes motors and gearing as well as any 3d printing needed)
- on-board MCU and peripheral circuit design
- wireless communication between vehicle and host method (may use wifi, bluetooth or simple IR)
- create some kind of interface (web or mobile) for controling the vehicle. (For wifi or socket based communication)

These milestones are not fixed and may be either removed or stratafied in the future depending on project direction.
